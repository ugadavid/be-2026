<p>When speaking, <strong>content words</strong> (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) generally receive more stress than <strong>function words</strong> (determiners, auxiliary verbs, prepositions). Which of these four types of content word receive the most emphasis will depend upon the context and meaning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listen to the following audio examples, and identify which words (and which syllables within those words) receive more stress. Then repeat the phrases aloud.</p>

<p>He has blue eyes.</p>

<p>This package is too heavy.</p>

<p>The baby slept soundly through the night.</p>

<p>He spoke softly to the child.</p>

<p>He is currently living in the centre of town, but he would like to move to a rural village.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If in doubt concerning word and syllable stress, check a dictionary. Word stress is usually indicated by an apostrophe (&#39;) placed before the stressed syllable.&nbsp;(ex. &lsquo;heavy, inter&rsquo;national)</p>
