<p class="alert alert-info">You are going to make your own word spiderweb using the word &quot;play&quot;.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Write down the first words that come to mind when you think of the word &quot;play&quot;. Remember it can have multiple meanings - consider this when shaping your &ldquo;web&rdquo; of words.</li>
	<li>Note down any phrases or expressions you have heard that you can remember that use the word &quot;play&quot; - for example, &quot;play on words&quot;, &quot;play to win&quot;.</li>
	<li>Look up the word &quot;play&quot; in an English dictionary, and note down some meanings you have not included. Add example phrases.<br />
	Possible online dictionary pages:<br />
	<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/play" class="external" target="_blank">Cambridge dictionary &gt; play</a><br />
	<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/play" class="external" target="_blank">Dictionary &gt; play</a></li>
	<li>Try to connect these meanings that are new to you, to words that you already know. Add these words to your spider web of words.<br />
	<strong>Taking the time to associate new knowledge with existing knowledge is an efficient method for remembering new vocabulary.</strong></li>
	<li>Choose one of the meanings of the word &quot;play&quot; that is new to you. Try to picture yourself in a situation where you would use this word. Imagine using it with your friends, family, or someone close to you. What could you be talking about? What would you say?<br />
	Example: I went to see a play at the theatre. My favourite actor was playing the main role. His latest film is playing at the cinema at the moment.<br />
	<strong>Trying to connect vocabulary to personal experience is a very powerful method for memorising. If you can bring in humour and/or emotions you are even more likely to remember it!</strong></li>
	<li>Write down your own sentences using the word &quot;play&quot; based on your own experience and/or imagination. Your brain is more likely to remember the words if they are relevant for you.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 for other meanings of the word &quot;play&quot;.</li>
